# Scrolling-LEDs
A Verilog-based Scrolling LED Display implemented on an FPGA using Vivado. The design uses a clock divider and shift-register logic to create smooth left/right LED scrolling. Demonstrates FPGA timing control, digital design, hardware mapping, and real-time visual output on on-board LEDs. Simple, fast, and beginner-friendly project.
I built the design in Vivado, added constraints, generated the bitstream, and seeing the LEDs scroll on hardware for the first time was truly motivating.

Key learnings:

Complete FPGA flow: design → synthesis → implementation → hardware

How clocks, counters, and timing behave on real devices

Debugging differences between simulation and hardware
Taking the first step makes everything easier.
