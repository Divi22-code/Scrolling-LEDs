# Scrolling-LEDs
A Verilog-based Scrolling LED Display implemented on an FPGA using Vivado. The design uses a clock divider and shift-register logic to create smooth left/right LED scrolling. Demonstrates FPGA timing control, digital design, hardware mapping, and real-time visual output on on-board LEDs. Simple, fast, and beginner-friendly project.
